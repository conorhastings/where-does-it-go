# Where does It Go?

A simple react based application that outputs a D3 powered "funnel" graph that displays where money is being spent in an organization. Pass an array of objects to the "breakdown" prop that assign a displayName to as section of the funnel as well as a percentage with a number from 0 to 1 determing the weight of that particular cost.
